## Ideas

- Dynamic obstacles (thymio)
- Dynamic goal (thymio in known zone or trajectory)

- Recover a (sleeping/moving) thymio
- make it follow the lead thymio either with communication (ir or wifi) or just using proximity sensors (assuming no obstacles on the way back)
- check if someone has lego to do some tasks

## TODO
- define env
- define global obstacles
- define local obstacles


- chose algo to implement

## Deliverables
A Jupyter notebook which serves as a report. This must contain the information regarding :
● The members of the group, it’s helpful to know who you are when we go over the report. ● An introduction to your environment and to the choices you made.
● Sections that go into a bit more detail regarding the implementation and are accompanied by the code required to execute the different modules independently. What is important is not to simply describe the code, which should be readable, but describe what is not in the code: the theory behind, the choices made, the measurements, the choice of parameters etc. Do not forget to cite your sources ! You can of course show how certain modules work in simulation here, or with pre-recorded data.
● A section which is used to run the overall project and where we can see the path chosen, where the system believes the robot is along the path before and after filtering etc… This can also be done in a .py file if you prefer. Just make sure to reference it in the report so we can easily have a look at it.
● Conclusion
The code used to execute the overall project. Do not hesitate to make use of .py files that you import in the notebook. The whole body of code does not have to be in the Jupyter notebook, on the contrary! Make sure the code clean and well documented. Somebody who starts to browse through it should easily understand what you are doing.
