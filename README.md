## Ideas

- Dynamic obstacles (thymio)
- Dynamic goal (thymio in known zone or trajectory)

- Recover a (sleeping/moving) thymio
- make it follow the lead thymio either with communication (ir or wifi) or just using proximity sensors (assuming no obstacles on the way back)
- check if someone has lego to do some tasks

## TODO
- define env
- define global obstacles
- define local obstacles


- chose algo to implement
