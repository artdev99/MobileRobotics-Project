    "A **Jupyter notebook** which serves as a report. This must contain the information regarding :\n",
    "- The **members of the group**, it’s helpful to know who you are when we go over the report.\n",
    "- An **introduction to your environment** and to the **choices you made**.\n",
    "- Sections that go into a bit **more detail regarding the implementation** and are accompanied by the code required to **execute the different modules independently**. What is important is not to simply describe the code, which should be readable, but describe what is not in the code: the theory behind, the choices made, the measurements, the choice of parameters etc. Do not forget to **cite your sources** ! You can of course show how certain modules work in **simulation here, or with pre-recorded data**.\n",
    "- A section which is used to **run the overall project** and where we can see the path chosen, where the system believes the robot is along the path before and after filtering etc… This can also be done **in a .py file** if you prefer. Just make sure to reference it in the report so we can easily have a look at it.\n",
    "- Conclusion: The code used to execute the overall project. Do not hesitate to **make use of .py files** that you import in the notebook. The whole body of code does not have to be in the Jupyter notebook, on the contrary! Make sure the **code clean and well documented**. Somebody who starts to browse through it should easily understand what you are doing."
